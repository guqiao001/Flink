The Apache Flink community is happy to announce the release of Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.2.0!
This release introduces major features that extend the SDKs, such as support for asynchronous functions in the Python SDK,
new persisted state constructs, and a new SDK that allows embedding StateFun functions within a Flink DataStream job.
Moreover, weâ€™ve also included important changes that improve out-of-the-box stability for common workloads,
as well as increased observability for operational purposes.
